This exam has 5 "questions", each represented by unit tests. You must implement the Sudoku class methods to ensure that the unit tests pass correctly. The premise of this code is that it implements a smaller version of Sudoku (to keep things tractable for you). In this case, Sudoku is a 4x4 square, with four 2x2 subsquares containing permuations of 1 through 4 (and rows/columns also containing permutations of 1 through 4).

If you're not familiar with Sudoku, please see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku.

An example input file is as follows:

    *4*1
    3***
    ***4
