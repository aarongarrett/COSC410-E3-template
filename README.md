This exam has 5 "questions", each associated with a unit test. You must implement the methods marked and described in the SlidingPuzzle class to make those tests pass. The purpose of this class is to provide a class 8-puzzle or sliding puzzle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle).

There are some private convenience methods that have already been implemented that you may find useful. The methods you must implement are 

public Point findBlankTile()
public Point getNeighbor(Point p, Direction d) 
public void slide(Direction d)
public boolean isSolved()
public String toString()


The descriptions of each are commented in the code.
